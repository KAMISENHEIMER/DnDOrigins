# DnDOrigins
A Dungeons and Dragons inspired expansion for the Minecraft Origins mod.  
Forked from [ArtificerSMPOrigins](https://github.com/JaredWood-Dev/AritificerSMPOrigins) by JaredWood-Dev and KAMISENHEIMER,  
to create a more focused experience, centered on the base 10 DnD species.

## Setup
1. Extract the ZIP file to the 'datapacks' folder inside the world folder.  
2. In-game run `datapacks enable "artificersmporigins"`.
